# Piezoelectric-Energy-Harvest

"I have designed and simulated a system with a frequency of 3 Hz, and I've considered various load resistances (1 ohm, 10 ohm, 100 ohm, 200 ohm, 300 ohm, 400 ohm, 500 ohm, 600 ohm, 700 ohm, 800 ohm, 900 ohm, and 1k ohm), capacitor values (47uF, 470uF, 680uF, 1000uF, and 4700uF, all rated at 50V), and inductor values ranging from 2mH to 100H with ten different values.

To address my teacher's requirements, I have focused on four key parameters: capacitor value, frequency (fixed at 3 Hz), load type, and the type of excited magnets.

In line with my project, I implemented Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize the energy storage conditions, as outlined in the paper titled 'Dynamic analysis and performance optimization of permendur cantilevered energy harvester' published in Smart Structures and Systems, Volume 23, Number 5, May 2019 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.12989/sss.2019.23.5.421).

I believe that Minitab Software from App AnyWhere is well-suited for conducting RSM. Before running the experiments, I have prepared a table to outline the experimental conditions and variations, taking into account the four parameters mentioned earlier. This approach will help us systematically explore and optimize the energy storage conditions for our project."
